# JavaOOPS
This project focuses on developing a Hotel Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java. The system is designed to handle the basic operations of a hotel, such as checking in and checking out guests, and it is implemented using various OOP principles and Java features.

Key Concepts Covered:
Inheritance: Used to define a hierarchical relationship between classes.
Polymorphism: Allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
Interfaces: Define methods that a class must implement, providing a way to enforce certain behaviors.
This keyword: Refers to the current instance of a class.
Exception Handling: Manages errors and other exceptional events.
Super keyword: Refers to the superclass (parent class) and is used to access methods and constructors of the superclass.
Conditional Loops: Used for repeating operations until a certain condition is met.
Method Overriding: Allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.
Method Overloading: Allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in a class.
Switch Case: Provides a way to execute different parts of code based on the value of an expression.
Packages: Organizes classes and interfaces into namespaces, making them easier to manage and use.
Applet Code:
The project includes an applet that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for checking in and checking out guests. The applet uses:

TextField for inputting guest names and room numbers.
Button for check-in and check-out actions.
TextArea for displaying logs of check-ins and check-outs.
